## to connect to SQL server and create dataframe
import pandas as pd
import pyodbc

#server and DB names just as examples

sql_conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};
                            SERVER=SQLSERVER2017;
                            DATABASE=Adventureworks;
                            Trusted_Connection=yes') 

#sample query, select the columns you need from table 'sales'

query = "SELECT [BusinessEntityID],[FirstName],[LastName],
                 [PostalCode],[City] FROM [Sales]"
                 
#SQL query to dataframe
df = pd.read_sql(query, sql_conn)

df.head(3)


#LEFT JOIN - for example if you had to add the Entity Name to your query
#you can use the field [BusinessEntityID] and bring the column you need from a different table that contains both fields

FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2(table with [BusinessEntityID] and Entity_Name)
ON table1.[BusinessEntityID] = table2.[BusinessEntityID];
